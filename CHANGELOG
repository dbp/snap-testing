0.6.0.0 - 2014-7-8 - Add additional helpers, and use much faster method of running tests.
  * The biggest change is because of a patch to snap that allows us to only run the
	initializer once for an entire test suite, which can easily be an order of
	magnitude (or more) speedup.
  * Also add a test-suite to the library.

0.5.0.0 - Not released to hackage - Redesign library around richer types and Applicative.
  * Basic building block is should/shouldNot, which lift a pure test function
	into the SnapTesting monad.
  * get / post create rich response type.
  * Add html / css matcher predicates.

0.4.1.1 - 2014-3-20 - Add this changelog to hackage, grammar in comments.

0.4.1.0 - 2014-3-20 - Add form tests, assert.
  * Add form test utility that runs digestive forms against values and checks that they
	either produce a given value (one form of test) or produce a set of errors
	specified by the paths to the form.
  * Add assert that lifts a Bool into a TestPass or TestFail.

0.4.0.0 - 2014-3-20 - Change interface to a conf, and add TestError variant,
	for when tests don't fail, but have an unexpected error. This breaks
	the API.

0.3.0.0 - 2014-3-5 - Switch to streaming interface for report generators.
 * Streams uses io-streams (a soon-to-be dependency of snap), and allow
	test results to be reported immediately, not only at the end of the test run.

0.2.1.0 - 2014-2-11 - Add support for get requests with parameters.

0.2.0.1 - 2014-2-3 - Fix bug in redirectsto.
  * redirectsto would try to get the location header using a partial function
	regardless of whether it was a redirect, causing the whole test suite
	to fail.


0.2.0.0 - 2014-1-13 - Renaming root.
  * Snap.Testing becomes Snap.Test.BDD, as per comment by @gregorycollins.

0.1.0.0 - 2014-1-13 - Initial release
